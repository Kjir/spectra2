Requirements

 - Intel Integrated Performance Primitives (http://software.intel.com/en-us/intel-ipp/) [Tested with  6.0.2.076 and 6.1.2.051]
 - Boost version 1.36.0 or greater (http:/www.boost.org/) [Tested with 1.39.0 and 1.42.0]
 - Boost::threadpool library (http://threadpool.sourceforge.net/) [Tested with 0.2.5]

Compiling

To compile the project you need autoconf and automake. To generate the necessary files run
autoreconf -i
Then you can run ./configure and make to compile the project

Testing

To test the functions, use the programs in test. Use the --help flag to have some descriptions about the flags available.
To see a graphical representation of the output, use the extra/plot.py script.

Sample usage

./test/siggen -l 2048 | ./test/fft -r 8 -n 4 -a 1 -p 12 -t 1 -o fft.sig
python extra/plot.py -f fft.sig -l 256

Time test

In the test directory there is a program called time and one called multi. They both test the time taken by each function to compute it's results. To see a graph of the results you can use gnuplot:
$ gnuplot
gnuplot> plot "order.dat" smooth sbezier
gnuplot> plot "order_int.dat" smooth sbezier
gnuplot> plot "integration.dat" smooth sbezier
gnuplot> plot "nomulti.dat" smooth sbezier
gnuplot> plot "multi5.dat" smooth sbezier
